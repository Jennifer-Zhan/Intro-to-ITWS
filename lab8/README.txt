Successful code to make the browser jump to http://www.rpi.edu when the user clicks "submit":
"<script>window.location="https://www.rpi.edu"</script>"

When we insert Hey there <script>alert("Hi there");</script>, we get a alert of "hi there" and the output text under will show "Hey there".

When we insert We got your cookie <script>alert(document.cookie);</script>, we get the alert of document.cookie and it is set in the JS file.
After submitting, the output text under will change to "We got your cookie" which is calling the function in the JS file.
